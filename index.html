    <h1>Hannibal - The Battle of Cannae</h1>
    <p>
      The Battle of Cannae was a major battle of the Second Punic War that took place on 2 August 216 BC in Apulia, in
      southeast Italy. The army of Carthage, under Hannibal, surrounded and decisively defeated a larger army of the
      Roman Republic under the consuls Lucius Aemilius Paullus and Gaius Terentius Varro. It is regarded both as one of
      the greatest tactical feats in military history and as one of the worst defeats in Roman history.
    </p>
    <h1>Aftermath of the Battle of Cannae</h1>
    <p>
      For a brief period, the Romans were in complete disarray. Their best armies in the peninsula were destroyed, the
      few remnants severely demoralized, and the only remaining consul (Varro) completely discredited. As the story
      goes, Rome declared a national day of mourning as there was not a single person who was not either related to or
      acquainted with a person who had died. The Romans became so desperate that they resorted to human sacrifice, twice
      burying people alive at the Forum of Rome and abandoning an oversized baby in the Adriatic Sea (perhaps one of the
      last instances of human sacrifices by the Romans, apart from public executions of defeated enemies dedicated to
      Mars).
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately after Cannae, Hannibal sent a delegation led by Carthalo to negotiate a peace treaty with the Senate
      on moderate terms. Despite the multiple catastrophes Rome had suffered, the Senate refused to parley. Instead,
      they redoubled their efforts, declaring full mobilization of the male Roman population, and raised new legions,
      enlisting landless peasants and even slaves. So firm were these measures that the word "peace" was prohibited,
      mourning was limited to only 30 days, and public tears were prohibited even to women. For the remainder of the war
      in Italy, they did not amass such large forces under one command against Hannibal; they used several independent
      armies, still outnumbering the Punic forces in numbers of armies and soldiers. The war still had occasional
      battles, but was focused on taking strongpoints and constant fighting according to the Fabian strategy. This
      finally forced Hannibal with his shortage of manpower to retreat to Croton from where he was called to Africa for
      the battle of Zama, ending the war with a complete Roman victory.

    <h1>Ancient Egypt - The Pharaoh</h1>
    <p>
      Pharaoh is the common title of the monarchs of ancient Egypt from the First Dynasty (c. 3150 BCE) until the
      annexation of Egypt by the Roman Empire in 30 BCE, although the actual term "Pharaoh" was not used
      contemporaneously for a ruler until Merneptah, c. 1200 BCE. In the early dynasty, ancient Egyptian kings used to
      have up to three titles, the Horus, the Sedge and Bee name, and the Two Ladies name. The Golden Horus and nomen
      and prenomen titles were later added.
    </p>
    <h1>The Tombs of Pharaoh</h1>
    <p>
      The tombs of pharaohs and their style of burials changed through the ages of ancient Egyptian history. The death
      and funerary rituals always included embalming and the process of mummification. The burial of a pharaoh took
      place 70 days after the death and included an elaborate funeral procession to the designated tomb of the dead king
      or queen. The mummies of the deceased pharaohs were placed in a sarcophagus which was decorated with their
      likeness interred in the tombs of pharaohs.
    </p>
    <h1>The Pyramids</h1>
    <p>
      The most famous pyramids are the Egyptian — huge structures built of brick or stone, some of which are among the
      world's largest constructions. They are shaped as a reference to the rays of the sun. Most pyramids had a
      polished, highly reflective white limestone surface, to give them a shining appearance when viewed from a
      distance. The capstone was usually made of hard stone – granite or basalt – and could be plated with gold, silver,
      or electrum and would also be highly reflective. After 2700 BC, the ancient Egyptians began building pyramids,
      until around 1700 BC. The first pyramid was erected during the Third Dynasty by the Pharaoh Djoser and his
      architect Imhotep. This step pyramid consisted of six stacked mastabas. The largest Egyptian pyramids are those at
      the Giza pyramid complex. The Egyptian sun god Ra, considered the father of all pharaohs, was said to have created
      himself from a pyramid-shaped mound of earth before creating all other gods.
